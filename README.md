## Hubble Mainnet Network Config

This repo contains the hubble mainnet's network config. It can be updated to:

1. Add PeerIDs to the mainnet allow list
2. Remove/Deny PeerIDs from the mainnet allow list
3. Set a minimum App Version for Hubble

### Usage

Add PeerIDs to `networkConfig.js` as needed. Hubble will re-download the network config every hour.
